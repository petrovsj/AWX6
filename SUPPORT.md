# Community Supported

The software and templates in this repository are released under an as-is, best effort,
support policy. This software should be seen as community supported and Zscaler's Technology Alliances
will contribute our expertise as and when possible.
We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of the project through our normal support options such as Zscaler support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support options. The underlying product uses (Zscaler Private Access API) by the scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or script itself. Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zscaler) or sites other than our official [Downloads page](https://support.zscaler.com) are provided under the best effort policy.

As of version 2.13.0, this Collection of Ansible Modules for Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) is
[certified on Ansible Automation Hub](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/zscaler/zpacloud) and officially supported for Ansible subscribers. Ansible subscribers can engage
for support through their usual route towards Red Hat.
